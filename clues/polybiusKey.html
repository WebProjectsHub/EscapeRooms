The <i>Polybius square cipher</i>, also known as the Polybius checkerboard, is an ancient method for fractionating plaintext characters into a smaller set of symbols. It was invented by the Greek scholars Cleoxenus and Democleitus, and later popularized by the historian Polybius. This cipher was particularly useful for telegraphy and simplifying the transmission of messages over long distances.
